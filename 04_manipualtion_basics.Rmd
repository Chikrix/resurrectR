Some common data manipulation functions are `filter`, `select`, `mutate`, `group_by`, `summarise`, these are usually used when performing data manipulation.  

### Filter  

`filter()` allows us subset observations based on their values. The first argument is the name of the dataset, subsequest argument are the expressions for filtering the data frame. 

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

When comparing different floating numbers, use the `near` function. 

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1 & day == 1)
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```
