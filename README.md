# resurrectR

This project is for resurrecting my R knowledge. While Data science with Python is quite common, my aim would be data science with R and Kotlin. Python is also there as well, but my main focus would be R and Kotlin. So I'll have similar projects for both Kotlin and Python coming.

I'm using this [curriculum](https://dcl-2017-04.github.io/curriculum/upcoming.html) for this project. And some additional resources.
