# resurrectR

This project is for resurrecting my R knowledge. While Data science with Python is quite common, my aim would be data science with R and Kotlin. Python is also there as well, but my main focus would be R and Kotlin. So I'll have similar projects for both Kotlin and Python coming.

I'm using this [curriculum](https://dcl-2017-04.github.io/curriculum/upcoming.html) for this project. It relies mostly on [R for Data science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Other additional resources I'll be using includes  

- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)  
- R Cookbook by Paul Teetor  
- Machine Learning With R - Brent Lantz   
- Mastering Machine Learning With R - Cory Lesmeister
- Practical Machine Learning Cookbook by Athul Tripathi
- Machine Learning With R Cookbook by Yu Wei and co  
- Machine Learning for Hackers by Drew Conway and co
